On March 2022, I created Revolt-chan, Revolt's unofficial mascot and with that my first original drawn character. Since then I received ~~a ton~~ basically no feedback on it. ~~Some people~ Nobody has asked me about the potential future of this character, so let me explain.

## Redrawing

I am planning to redraw Revolt-chan at some point in the future, hopefully to improve on the terrible current design you're seeing above. I know I still have basically no experience in art but hopefully that's something I can fix.

## Redesigning

I'm not just planning to redraw Revolt-chan, I might also completely redo the character design as well. I think the current design is underwhelming, boring and lacking in originality. If you do have any suggestions for design features, feel free to let me know.

## But why?

Truth is, this whole idea came to frutition all because of a joke I made in the [Revolt Lounge](https://app.revolt.chat/invite/zTTDxWNd) server. Yeah that's all. Since then there have been quite a few potential mascots being submitted, and some honestly look amazing.

## A final reminder

Please remember that I currently have no intentions to pitch Revolt-chan as Revolt's official mascot. I am happy with this remaining unofficial. That being said, I am not against the idea of Revolt-chan being adopted as official.
