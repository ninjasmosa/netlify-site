# I've been there for too long
By this point I've been on Twitter for over 2 years. I honestly find this shocking considering how absolutely horrible Twitter as a whole is. It is a website full of snowflakes who'll get offended over everything, pedophiles, toxic fandoms and the like. But as much as I hate it I realized that I can't leave now. Doing so would be bad. Let me explain

# Internet friends
If there's one thing that Twitter did teach me, it's that you can indeed make friends over the internet. Across my time here I talked to people on this site and became friends with them somehow. I learned that while you may never meet these people in real life, that doesn't mean they can't be your friends. Indeed, social media and chatrooms have allowed us to talk to people who we may not have met otherwise. It's a groundbreaking technology, even if it isn't perfect.

# Sucked down the Twitter trap
Over the past couple of years, sites like Twitter and Instagram have defaulted to showing you posts decided by an algorithm rather than chronologically from the people you follow. This was mainly done to increase user retention and that's good for ad revenue. It does explain why people can essentially get 'addicted' to it though. After all the posts are even more tailored now and hooking user in longer, and all the company cares about is user retention and ad revenue.

## At least Twitter lets you see tweets the old way
I noticed that ever since I changed my Twitter to 'Latest tweets' mode from the default algorithm-sorted mode, I've been spending less time on the app. Maybe it's because the tweets weren't personalised by an algorithm or maybe I realized that I have a life outside a stupid bird app. I don't know.

# But I still won't be leaving
That's because I somehow managed to make friends on that site. Quite a few of them. I made a list of them that you can see [here](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1413541831237947395). To leave Twitter would mean potentially cutting off contact with these people and I'm not willing to do that. Maybe I got trapped in the trap, maybe it's for the better of my life, do I look like I know?
