## Why I currently do not support NFTs
I will never mint, sell, buy or endorse NFTs. NFTs are a scam, a waste of money and cause massive harm to the environment. The community is also horrible. Please do not support this fad and find other ways to support your favourite artists instead, like buying physical prints or direct commissions.

For the most part NFT's are little more than a digital token stored in the blockchain that link to a JPEG stored on a [Web2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) file sharing platform. They are also sold for ludicrous amounts of £ worth of [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum). But for me I will not be investing in a [pyramid scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme) used to sell stolen works as well as for [money laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering) and scams. Maybe NFTs do become big and I'll have missed out on an opportunity to make millions. However I do not care at all, and would much rather find better, more secure ways to sell my works than NFTs.

## You don't even own the picture, rather you just own a hyperlink to that picture
[According to an article from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/) and [a Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372165292751732740), since picture files are too big to be stored on the blockchain, they are instead hosted on a traditional Web2 hosting platform most likely on a server by some startup company. Should that service go bust, your picture will go down with it. Worse still, if that does happen, someone could theoretically buy out that domain name once used by said startup and use it for malicious purposes (malware, propaganda, inappropriate material...).

## Even the creator of NFTs hates what they have become
In that same Atlantic article, [Anil Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Dash), the creator of NFTs, says that he no longer wants his creation to be part of internet history or have any involvement in it. If even the creator of NFTs himself took a dislike towards them, then why not you?
![I certainly didn’t predict the current NFT mania, and until recently had written off our project as a footnote in internet history.](https://i.imgur.com/kgUgQW4.png "You know something is up when even the creator of NFTs himself hates them.")

## For decades we didn't need NFTs to earn from our art
We have already proven that we can make money from our art without the need of this so-called 'NFT revolution'. We used methods like physical print sales, commissions, OC adoptions and art trades. Who needs this NFT garbage when we can continue to earn from these traditional methods that earn us actual money not some unstable cryptocurrency?

## NFTs can be a lot more than what they are
There are so many things that NFTs could be used for. The idea of digital purchases not being in the hands of one centralized company and instead being in the blockchain in a decentralized form could be used for many big things. Whether it's game, movie or trading card ownership or more. But right now, they're not in a good state. I do not want to participate in a scheme that has so much for concern.

## Stolen works from me
If you see one of my art or videos being sold on an NFT marketplace like Opensea or Rareible, it is stolen. Please report the NFT for theft and let me know so I can take action. You can get in touch with me on Twitter or [email me at ninjasmosa@vivaldi.net](mailto:ninjasmosa@vivaldi.net?subject=Your%20work%20was%20stolen%20for%20an%20NFT%20sale).
