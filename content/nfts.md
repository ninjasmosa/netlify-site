## Why I currently do not support NFTs

I will never mint, sell, buy or endorse NFTs. NFTs are a scam, a waste of money and cause massive harm to the environment. The community is also horrible. Please do not support this fad and find other ways to support your favourite artists instead, like buying physical prints or direct commissions.

For the most part NFT's are little more than a digital token stored in the blockchain that link to a JPEG stored on a Web2 file sharing platform. They are also sold for ludicrous amounts of Â£ worth of Ethereum. But for me I will not be investing in a pyramid scheme used to sell stolen works as well as for money laundering and scams. Maybe NFTs do become big and I'll have missed out on an opportunity to make millions. However I do not care at all, and would much rather find better, more secure ways to sell my works than NFTs.
