My name's Addison, I use [They/She](https://en.pronouns.page/they&she) pronouns, I'm [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender) [(Demigirl)](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Demigirl) and I'm 16 years old. I really like Pokemon and Genshin Impact as well as various anime. I also like Vocaloid singers and editing wikis.
