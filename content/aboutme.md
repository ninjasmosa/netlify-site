## Intro

Hey! Nice to meet you! My name's Avery ([They/She](https://en.pronouns.page/they&she)). I am a fem-leaning non-binary person (femby is a term I've seen going around the internet).

You'll find write-ups and ramblings of varying types and topics here, which I don't imagine many people will read considering the highly-centralised nature of the modern internet.

## Other interests

These days, I am mainly interested in video games (numerous genres) and programming.
Some of my favourite video games include Pikmin 4, Persona 5, Project Sekai, Project Diva Mega Mix and Portal 2.
