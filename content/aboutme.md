## Intro

Hey! Nice to meet you! My name's Avery ([She/They](https://en.pronouns.page/@ninjasmosa)). I'm a trans girl basically living on the net for years at this point.

You'll find write-ups and ramblings of varying types and topics here, which I don't imagine many people will read considering the highly-centralised nature of the modern internet.

## Other interests

These days, I am mainly interested in video games (numerous genres) and programming.
Some of my favourite video games include Pikmin 4, Persona 5, Zenless Zone Zero, and Splatoon 3.
