## Intro
Hey! Nice to meet you! My name's Ashley and I'm 16 years old. I really like Pokemon and Genshin Impact as well as various anime. I also like Vocaloid singers and editing wikis.

## Other interests
I also have an interest in coding, cryptocurrency, networking and open-source software. Though I only have knowledge in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) I would like to learn more languages like [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)).
