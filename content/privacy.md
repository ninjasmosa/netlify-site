# Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user data. I am only using this to gain an understanding on my audience, not to sell data to advertisers or hunt you down. You can use [this browser extension](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to opt out of GA tracking. Alternatively you can use a tracker blocker. This may be included with your browser or you can install a browser extension.

I plan to migrate to Cloudflare Analytics in the near future, who claim to take privacy more seriously than Google. This all depends on whether Cloudflare wants to work however.
