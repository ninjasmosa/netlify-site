My privacy policy is simple. I don't do any first-party scraping of user data. I also do not sell any data that you pass onto me to any third-parties. However there are some things that you should keep in mind when using this website.

## Do Not Track

Do Not Track is an option you can enable in your web browser's settings. Currently enabling this feature does nothing in regards to visiting this website.

## Analytics

I use Cloudflare Web Analyics to measure analytics on my website. Cloudflare does not track users between websites nor do they use cookies for analytics. You can read more about this [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/web-analytics/) and [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/). You can find Cloudflare's privacy policy [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/).

## YouTube

Some pages contain videos embedded from YouTube. These videos do not have privacy-enhanced mode enabled so watching YouTube videos here may subject you to tracking by Google.

## Comments

I use [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) to provide comments for each articles on this website. Giscus does not do any tracking or advertising and is [free and open-source software](https://github.com/giscus/giscus). However to use this feature you will need an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You can find GitHub's privacy policy [here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Third-party trackers

I do not knowingly embed any third-party trackers that harvest data or fingerprint users between websites. However some pages embed content from external websites which may use their own trackers.
