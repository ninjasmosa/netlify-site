This website was built using Hugo, a static website builder coded in Go, and hosted on Netlify. The source code can be seen [on GitHub](https://github.com/ninjasmosa/ninjasmosa.com).

Written in a mix of markdown, HTML and CSS, I made this to replace my old website which was built on Google Sites, after finding it restrictive and being unable to get the custom domain to properly work.
Below is a screenshot of my old site:

Not only that it was also quite bloated, being slow to load on slow internet and was also tied to a big tech company. While the old website will continue to remain available [here](https://sites.google.com/view/ninjasmosa), this new one is what I will be updating long-term.
