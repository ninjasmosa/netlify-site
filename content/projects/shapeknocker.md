Shape Knocker is a game about knocking shapes off a platform while they try to knock you off. It was made with the Unity 3D engine for the [Unity Learn Junior Programmer](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer) course.

## Background

Part of the course involved me working on a personal project alongside the main learning material. The mechanics I would be taught ideally should be implemented into said personal project. I would eventually turn this project into what you are seeing now.

## Development

I started by creating a design document, which was the first thing I was required to do. I had initially planned for this to be a third-person shooter-like game, but the focus changed into a knock-enemies-off-a-platform type of game.

## Play Game

The game can be downloaded from my itch.io page. It can be played on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
