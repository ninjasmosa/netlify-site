# About this game
In this game, you find yourself trapped inside a cell in an underground chamber. Why you are here is unknown, however you should probably find a way out of here before something bad happens to you.

I wrote this game for a computer science project around a year or so ago (probably 2020/early 2021). It uses global variables, subroutines and else-if statements. Since the first inception I have replaced the static safe code with a random number generator that generates a random safe code every time the game is run.

# How to play
You can play the game online for free [on Replit](https://replit.com/@ninjasmosa/Escape-the-underground-cell?v=1) (also below). Alternatively you can [head onto the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ninjasmosa/Escape-the-underground-cell) to download the .py file and run it under your own Python IDE. You can even use it to make your own game! The joys of the MIT license.
