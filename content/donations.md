## Donating in Ethereum
Unfortunately I cannot provide specific instructions as there are different Ethereum wallets available. However it usually involves logging in to your Ethereum wallet and clicking the send option.
In the send menu make sure you send to the following address: ` 0x78a8Af863B61A6b981f667eCd611Df571DFB6555 `

This is my Ethereum wallet address. This is the only address I use. Any other addresses are not mine and you may be sending your money to someone else or even a fraudster.
